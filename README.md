Learned while pairing:
-make small changes frequently
- responsive design - design solutions in responsive ways -sizing the container is better than sizing the element - when you are looking at parent child relationship - you want a dynamic size for containers - e.g a button in a column- don't add size to button - add the size in the parent/column
